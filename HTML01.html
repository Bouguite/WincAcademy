<h1>2022 FIFA World Cup</h1>


    <p>Accusations of corruption have been made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia has since described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.Additionally, Qatar has faced strong criticism due to the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to "forced labour" and stating that hundreds or thousands of migrant workers have died as a result of human rights abuses, and careless and inhumane work conditions, despite worker welfare standards being drafted in 2014.</p>

    <p>
    Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Amnesty International referred to these measures as "a significant step towards protecting migrant workers" but added that "the Qatari authorities have much more work to do to end the systematic abuse of migrant workers".</p>

    <h2>Host selection</h2>
    <p>The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. Initially, eleven bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings, and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid. Indonesian officials had not ruled out a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, until Qatar took the 2022 cup. During the bidding process, all non-UEFA nations gradually withdrew their 2018 bids, thus guaranteeing that a UEFA nation would host the 2018 cup and thereby making UEFA nations ineligible for the 2022 bid.


    <p>Qatar is the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup â€“ the next smallest by area is Switzerland, host of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, which is more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of the current 32.

       Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay, as hosts of the first-ever World Cup) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition. Japan was previously awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 FIFA World Cup alongside South Korea without ever having qualified for the finals, although they subsequently qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.</p>

        <h2>Possible expansion</h2>

    <p>On 12 April 2018, CONMEBOL requested that FIFA expand the 2022 FIFA World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, four years before the 2026 FIFA World Cup as initially planned. FIFA President Gianni Infantino expressed willingness to consider the request. However, the FIFA congress rejected the request shortly before the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Infantino said the global football governing body would not discuss the possibility of having a 48-team World Cup, and that they would first discuss the matter with the host country.

        In March 2019, a "FIFA feasibility study" concluded that it was possible to expand the tournament to 48 teams, albeit with the assistance of "one or more" neighbouring countries and "two to four additional venues." FIFA also said that "while it cannot rule out legal action from losing bidders by changing the format [of the tournament], the study said it 'concluded that the risk was low'." FIFA and Qatar would have explored possible joint proposals to submit to the FIFA Council and the FIFA Congress later in June. Had a joint proposal been submitted, FIFA's member associations would have voted on the final decision at the 69th FIFA Congress in Paris, France, by 5 June. However, on 22 May, FIFA announced it would not expand the tournament.</p>

        <h2>Qualification</h2>
        <p>FIFA's six continental confederations organise their own qualifying competitions. All FIFA member associations, of which there are currently 211, are eligible to enter qualification. Qatar, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the AFC obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. If the Qataris reach the final stage as winners in their group or as one of the four best runners-up, the fifth-best team will advance instead. The reigning World Cup champions France will also go through qualifying stages as normal. Saint Lucia initially entered qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. American Samoa and Samoa both withdrew before the OFC draw.</p>

        <p>The 2022 World Cup is taking place in Qatar in the winter months rather than the usual summer ones, due to the heat. The tournament kicks off on Monday November 21 at the Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor with a match that will feature the host country.</p>
